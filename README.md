# Pulmonary Monitor Flutter App

The Pulmonary Monitor Flutter App is designed to monitor pulmonary (i.e., respiratory) symptoms.
It is build using the [CARP Mobile Sensing](https://pub.dev/packages/carp_mobile_sensing) 
Framework from the [Copenhagen Center for Health Technology](https://www.cachet.dk).

It follows the Flutter Business Logic Component (BLoC) architecture, as described in the 
[CARP Mobile Sensing App](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/tree/master/carp_mobile_sensing_app).
